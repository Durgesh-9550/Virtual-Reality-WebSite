                <p id="info-text">"Virtual reality is a simulated 3D environment that enables users to explore and interact with a virtual surrounding in a way that approximates reality, as it is perceived through the users' senses. The environment is created with computer hardware and software, although users might also need to wear devices such as helmets or goggles to interact with the environment. The more deeply users can immerse themselves in a VR environment -- and block out their physical surroundings -- the more they are able to suspend their belief and accept it as real, even if it is fantastical in nature"

            <h1>Virtual Reality Development</h1><br>
            <p>Virtual reality (VR) software development has become a new way to create media and entertainment. And it's used for more than game development. Industries — like automotive, virtual production, and more — are applying VR technology to simulate environments to train people and test products in real time.
            <br>
            VR content development is similar to 3D game development in that it the spatial design of a large, immersive 3D worlds that the player/user will traverse on her own. 3D game development/VR development foundations include: Learning how to use a 3D game engine (we recommend Unity).
            <br>
            To get started in virtual reality, it's important to engage with apps or games. Students can also study virtual reality development projects and what makes them successful. Through practical training, students can develop fluency in product design, video game design, 3D modeling, animation, and design theory.

                <h2>VR App Development</h2>
                <p>A VR developer creates whole new digital settings that users can see through a device like the Oculus headset, but an AR developer uses mobile apps to create a layer of digital experience in our reality, such as Pokemon Go, a game that uses this technology.VR systems do so by using computer vision and advanced graphics to generate 3D images and video by adding depth, and by reconstructing the scale and distances between static 2D images.Well, a VR app can typically be developed for anywhere between $30,000 and $150,000+, depending on the size and complexity of the app. Here's a detailed rundown of what you need to know about the costs and requirements associated with virtual reality mobile app development.It's not easy to make a VR game. You will need an extensive background in computer programming and VR development.</p>

                <h2>VR Design</h2>
                <p>VR design is the creation of a simulated world, which people can experience and immerse themselves in using hardware, like headsets.Virtual reality (VR) immerses users in a fully artificial digital environment. Augmented reality (AR) overlays virtual objects on the real-world environment.Virtual Reality comprises 4 primary elements: virtual world, immersion, sensory feedback, and interactivity.VR can be used in the design process to give a more accurate depiction and immersive creation of 3D models. When design engineers can see their models from different angles, it gives them a better idea of how to refine and improve them.Reality Design creates logo design, brand strategy, positioning and naming, through to design, artwork and production – we offer a complete solution for online and print.

                <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
                <p>Computer vision aids virtual reality with robust vision capabilities like SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping), SfM (structure from motion), user body tracking and gaze tracking. Using cameras and sensors, these functions help VR systems analyze the user's environment and detect the headset's location.Abstract Mobile augmented reality (AR) employs computer vision capabilities in order to properly integrate the real and the virtual, whether that integration involves the user's location, object-based interaction, 2D or 3D annotations, or precise align- ment of image overlays.AR, VR and mixed reality technologies have diverse capabilities. These all are used to create an entirely virtual environment, allowing users to experience a different world surrounding them. To accurately discern and identify the surroundings so that AR can add the virtual world to them requires computer vision.</p>
